<h1> UK Quantum Hackathon - July 2025</h1>

Dear participants,

Welcome to the cross-sector quantum hackathon organised by the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC). The hackathon is part of the NQCC’s Quantum Readiness programme, aimed at exploring and raising awareness of the current capabilities of quantum computing technology, as well as nurturing the talent pipeline and convening stakeholders.

The event is for master's students through to postdocs and early career researchers interested in the field of quantum computing. Several teams will be arranged, balancing skills and quantum expertise ahead of time. Each team will tackle one use case using a quantum computing platform and an emulator. You have also been allocated a backup quantum computing platform. Information on the use cases and training on accessing quantum computers will be provided to the teams ahead of time through this private GitHub repository and your private Slack channel. During the hackathon, mentors from the industry and the quantum providers will support the teams. The event will close with a judging panel scoring the proposed solutions and announcing the winning team.

The main objectives of the Hackathon are to:
- Connect the UK quantum ecosystem through networking and collaboration throughout the event
- Explore use cases for quantum computing
- Enable aspiring practitioners to develop their quantum computing programming and applications skills
- Showcase the breadth of technology available currently and enable a broad range of users to access these tools
- Understand the opportunities and limitations of quantum computing by demonstrating the current capabilities of the technology

<h1>About the NQCC</h1>

Funded through UKRI, the NQCC is dedicated to accelerating the development of quantum computing by addressing the challenges of scalability. The Centre is working with businesses, government and the research community to deliver quantum computing capabilities for the UK and support the growth of the emerging industry.

<h1>GitHub</h1>

This GitHub repository contains all the information related to the computational challenge proposed by your industrial end-user, which you will have to solve!
The technical team of each repository includes:
- The hackers that will be tackling the problem
- The end-user mentors related to the use case
- The quantum provider mentors allocated to the use case
- Members of the organising team

<h1>Slack</h1>

To ensure efficient communication, we also provide you with access to the hackathon’s Slack channel, where you can get technical support from providers and organisers. If you have not been provided with access to the Slack space, please speak to a member of the organising team.

<h1>Organisation</h1>

The event takes place on July 21-24 of 2025 at the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom. Arrival for the event is on Sunday 20th July and the NQCC is providing accommodation for the nights of 20th, 21st and 22nd July. For more information on the organisation of the event, please refer to your information pack.

<h1>Presentations and Judging Panel</h1>

Each team will have 12 minutes (10 minutes for presentations and 2 minutes for questions) to present their solution. The solutions will be scored by the judges on the following criteria:

Criterion 1: Success of the solution for the given use case (out of 10).

Criterion 2: Use of quantum computing resources (out of 10).

Criterion 3: Creativity and novelty of the solution given initial use case (out of 10).

Criterion 4: Investigation into scaling and feasibility (out of 10). 

Criterion 5: Responsible and ethical quantum computing considerations (out of 10).

Criterion 6: Quality of the presentation – clarity, engagement, length (out of 5). Note that your  presentation runs longer than 10 minutes, you will be down-scored by 0.5 points per minute. 

Criterion 7: Quality of the Q&A (out of 5). 

A ceremony will follow the judging, during which prizes will be awarded to the three highest-scoring teams.

<h1>The Judges</h1>

The judging panel for the hackathon consists of:
- Sir Peter Knight
